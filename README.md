## 🧩 Featured Projects
- **Retail Demand Forecasting** — end‑to‑end model with feature engineering, ML, and a Streamlit demo app.
- **Inventory Optimization (EOQ + ROP)** — a tiny optimizer for replenishment policy with uncertainty.
- **Vendor Performance Dashboard (Power BI)** — On‑Time/ In‑Full, lead time reliability, and Pareto insights.

## 🔬 What I do
- Translate business questions into experiments and KPIs.
- Build reproducible data pipelines and models (seeds, envs, tests).
- Ship demo apps so stakeholders can “feel” the model before rollout.

## 📌 How to navigate
- Pinned repositories = best work.
- Each repo has: **Problem → Data → Method → Results → Demo → How to run**.
